### Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern is a software architectural design pattern commonly used in the development of user interfaces, particularly in web and desktop applications. It divides an application into three interconnected components, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Model:**
   - The Model represents the application's data and business logic.
   - It is responsible for managing the data and the rules for updating or processing it.
   - The Model notifies the View when there are changes in the data, ensuring that the user interface remains synchronized with the underlying data.

2. **View:**
   - The View is responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user input.
   - It displays the information from the Model to the user in a way that is suitable for presentation (UI).
   - The View is also responsible for capturing user input and forwarding it to the Controller for processing.

3. **Controller:**
   - The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
   - It receives user input from the View, processes it (often involving interactions with the Model), and updates the View accordingly.
   - The Controller interprets user actions, translates them into operations on the Model, and updates the View to reflect any changes in the Model.

#### Key Features of MVC Pattern:

- **Separation of Concerns:** MVC separates the application logic into three distinct components, promoting a clear division of responsibilities. This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain and understand.

- **Reusability:** Each component (Model, View, and Controller) can be reused in different parts of the application or even in different applications altogether, enhancing code reusability.

- **Scalability:** The modular structure of MVC allows for easier scalability, as changes in one component do not necessarily affect the others. This makes it easier to extend or modify the application over time.

- **Testability:** Because of the separation of concerns, each component can be tested independently, making it easier to write unit tests for the Model, View, and Controller.

MVC is a widely adopted architectural pattern and serves as the foundation for many other design patterns and frameworks, contributing to the development of robust, scalable, and maintainable software applications.
